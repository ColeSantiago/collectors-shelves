Only ten photos will show up at a time. More photos can be rendered by clicking the 'Load More' button at the bottom of the page.

**Clicking on any of these photos will bring you to the collection they belong to, with the user they belong to at the top of the page**

Users can add as many collections as they want. Once created photos can be uploaded to that sepcific collection, and their titles can be edited.

## User Specific

Both the Profiles and Collections have specifc views depending on whether the user owns the profile or collection.

On your profile and collection you will see all of your editing options, while on others you will only things like Add Friend, or the applaud button.
